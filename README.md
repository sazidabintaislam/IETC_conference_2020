# Herpetofauna Species Classification from Images with Deep Neural Network

This repo contains codes for the research work of IETC_2020 conference publication. In this paper, A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture has been suggested to classify any two species automatically. As an initial experiment, a binary CNN network has been trained and validated to classify snakes, and toads/frog with 9,000 samples collected from various internet public databases. The model evaluation achieved 76% accuracy on average for the test data that supports the prospects for the recommended model. 

A callback function has been applied to the model that stops the training procedure after reaching a particular accuracy/loss score. In thia ripository contains two seperate code: with and without callback function.
